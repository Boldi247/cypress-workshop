# Cypress Workshop

In this project, I'd like to showcase the basic usage of Cypress as an E2E testing framework.

> [!NOTE]  
> The project has two branches:

- main
- cypress

The main branch has the untested, sample project. This is where you can practice, or follow along with me during the workshop.

The cypress branch contains the solution (= the E2E tests for the project)

The project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Installing the project

```
npm install
```

## Running the development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Running Cypress - with GUI

```
npm run cypress:open
```
